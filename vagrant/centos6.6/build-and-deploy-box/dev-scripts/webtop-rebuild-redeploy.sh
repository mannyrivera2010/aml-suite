# Assumes code on host lives
# in ~/ozp/ozp-center (modify the Vagrantfile if ~/ozp is not where you want
# your host code to live, then modify this script accordingly)

# modify the dev-sync-and-run.sh script to run this script for easier use from
# the host

# make sure these variables are the same as those used during the initial
# vagrant up, or this will not work
