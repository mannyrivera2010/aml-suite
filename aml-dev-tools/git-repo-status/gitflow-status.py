"""
Provides status information on the repos in ozone-development

NOTE: All this is available via the GitHub API!!!!

Want to do this totally front-end, no DB. Use React, gulp, wepback(?), flux?, basic auth? Keep "sprint" 
functionality simple - allow user to enter start date, end date to control what is shown in 
current sprint

Jenkins job status?

Pages/tabs:
1. Overview (project names, current versions, links to latest releases)
2. Project Details (errors in workflow, commits in develop not on mater, outstanding PRs)
3. User Details (Each person w/ list of assigned, active, and finished issues)
4. Issues (by repo and by state)?
5. Sprint summary (num commits by person this sprint, issues closed this sprint, PRs merged this sprint)
6. Links

CURRENT DATA 
- - - - - - - - 
Report errors in workflow, such as:
   - commits on master that are not in develop (or a release branch)
   - commits on a release branch not in develop

Report the latest tagged release version and date of each project (on master), 
as well as the latest tagged pre-release (on develop)

Links to download tarballs of latest releases and pre-releases for each project

Report number of commits on develop not on master (and provide link to diff?)

Report all feature branches

Running total of user contributions to each repo (# of issues closed per repo or # of PRs merged per repo)

Outstanding PRs for all repos

List all issues in progress (and who is assigned to them)

TIMEBOXED DATA (from x -y)
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Report basic contributor statistics (number of commits this period)

List all PRs merged in during this period and/or list all issues closed during this sprint

Other things maybe
- - - - - - - - - - 
Delete all pre-releases
Trigger Jenkins build
Link to other resources (huboard, deployment boxes, CI boxes, documentation, GH repos)


A generic site to do this, assumptions being:
1. Uses GitHub
2. Has several repositories in a single organization
3. Using single centralized "repository" model (not forks)
4. Uses GitFlow (historic branches for the latest and for releases) or master /w tags(can we support that?)
5. Uses GitHub Releases functionality
