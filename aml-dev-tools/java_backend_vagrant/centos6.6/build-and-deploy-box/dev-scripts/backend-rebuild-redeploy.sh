# Use case: developer working on ozp-rest on host box, needs to build and
#  redeploy on VM. Assumes all config files are already in place and no changes
# to them, or do the database, are required

# Assumes code on host lives
# in ~/ozp/ozp-rest (modify the Vagrantfile if ~/ozp is not where you want
# your host code to live, then modify this script accordingly)

# modify the dev-sync-and-run.sh script to run this script for easier use from
# the host

# make sure these variables are the same as those used during the initial
# vagrant up, or this will not work
