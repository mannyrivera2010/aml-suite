# Purpose
Notifications are system-provided messages that deploy to each relevant individual user. The intent is for Notifications to be available to be sent from the system, from any individual organization, or from an application.

  * System-wide
  * Agency-wide

  * PermissionDenied('Only app mall stewards can create system notifications')
* Only ORG_STEWARD can create agency-wide notifications
  * PermissionDenied('Only org stewards can create agency notifications')

## Receiving Notifications
* For the system messages, every user should receive the notification.
* For the organizations' messages (agency-wide), every user associated with the organization should receive the notification.
* For the applications/listings, every user who has bookmarked the listing should receive the notification.

## Sending Notifications
* Owners of listings will be able to send messages only from their listing. These messages will need to be approved by a Steward of the listing's associated organization and then by a Marketplace Steward.
* Organization Stewards will be able to send messages from their organization or any listing associated with their organization.
* Marketplace Stewards will be able to send messages from the system, an organization, or any listing. These messages will not need to be approved by any other Steward.

## Authorization
* Any User can view a System-wide notification from the system.
* Only user authorized should be able to delete the notifications.

**Related Issues:**
https://github.com/aml-development/aml-backend/issues/122

## Protocol
  * Shall be possible to have notifications in JSON Formats and over HTTP/HTTPS transports

## Sorting Notification
**Usage:**
Default response is Descending    
```
GET /api/self/notification/?ordering=-created_date   # Descending
or
GET /api/self/notification/?ordering=created_date  # Ascending
```

## 2017 Redesign
### Goal
Propose redesign of back-end architecture to inbox style (beneficial to use a task manager like celery)   

### Backlog
"As developer, propose redesign of back-end architecture to create a solution that provides capabilities to manage current, proposed and future notification requirements."    

**Email**    
The notification system shall integrate with email system

### Proposed Solution    
* Mailbox style, Every user will have an inbox.   
* When a system wide notification occurs, it will make a list of all users in the system and put a message in the 'inbox'  of each user
* When a listing notification occurs, it will make a list of all users that has a listing bookmark and put a message in the 'inbox'  of each user
* When an agency-wide notification occurs, it will make a list of all user in that agency and put a message in the 'inbox' of each user
* When a peer-to-peer bookmark notification occurs
  * https://github.com/aml-development/aml-backend/issues/129
* Pub/Sub Events system for system actions events (Category Notification)

## Research
* https://github.com/mcomp2010-forks/Stream-Framework    
* http://highscalability.com/blog/2013/7/8/the-architecture-twitter-uses-to-deal-with-150m-active-users.html
* http://www.slideshare.net/rabbitmq/why-databases-suck-for-messaging

### Steps
* Create new Model for redesigned Notification
* Iterate thorough all the current Notifications and put in new Notification Model
* Refactor All the Notification methods to use new Notification Model

## Software Code
### Current Endpoints/Views:
* /api/self/notification/
  * UserNotificationViewSet
* /api/notifications/
  * NotificationViewSet
* /api/notifications/pending/
  * PendingNotificationView
* /api/notifications/expired/
  * ExpiredNotificationView

### Methods
* Get all notifications
* Get all pending notifications
* Get all expired notifications
* Create a Notification
* Delete/Dismiss a notifications
* Get notifications for a user
  * Sort by date
* Update notifications Expired Date
* Email Batch
  * When email_batch command occurs, it will go to every users' 'mailbox' to check if email_status on the notification is false, do the count, make value true, and email user the new notification count and telling them to login.

## Questions (past)
* Will messages from organizations have to be approved by the Marketplace Steward?
    * Can Org. Stewards cancel their notifications without approval from the Marketplace Steward?
* Will messages created by Org Stewards or MP Stewards for/from listings need to be approved in the typical fashion? (By Org Stewards and then by MP Stewards)
* What level of information about all the current notifications should Org Stewards have?
    * Should the get to see all the other orgs' notifications but not interact?
    * Should they only get to see notifications from their own org(s) and the listings associated with their org?
    * Should they get to see aml Platform notifications?
* Can an owner cancel an approved notification?
