There are 4 boxes in the above CI Configuration.    
Note:  Jenkins slave is not necessary    

### Boxes

* Jenkins Master - Is the main Jenkins Instance
    * DNS: jenkins.domain.com
* Jenkins Slave - It is the machine used to run all the build to deploy it to deployment machines
    * It will build any jobs with the label `proj`
    * Will be responsible of creating release archive(tar) file then use ssh publisher to deployment machine
    * DNS: ci-jenkins.proj.domain.com
* ci-latest - deployment of master branch
    * Will be responsible of using release archive(tar) with ansible to install software locally (will have sub build per repo)
    * DNS: ci-latest.proj.domain.com
* ci-release - deployment of latest release tag
    * DNS: ci-release.proj.domain.com


## Jenkins Jobs
There will be 4 jobs per git repo (release and latest)

Git Repos and Jobs names

* aml-center
    * center-latest-test
